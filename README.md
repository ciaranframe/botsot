Welcome to BOTSOT! 


BOTSOT is the Botanical Sonification Toolbox – a series of generative sonic tools created toexplore invisible communications, structures and information within plant species. Developed as aseries of modular Max/MSP instruments, generative processes and a graphical user interface areused to reveal discrete, user-generated sonic representations, thus extending knowledge andunderstanding of botanical life – a world that is often only fully accessible to scientists. Through theuse of data sets and quantifiable characteristics of any given plant species, BOTSOT allows forcomparisons, iterative compositions and educational experiences, as well as deeper insights intoplants through the medium of music.
